        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] Try to improve the fit of your armor where you crafted it so there''s less gaps to get stabbed. Takes some extra material but it''s worth it'
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] You can''t really temper leather or anything, but you can coat them in wax or stud them with some iron nuggets.'
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] You can heat metal ingots and items on a campfire, but it''ll remove any tempering you did to it making it very soft.'
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] I''ve heard of an otherworldly metal so strong you can''t even use regular fire to forge it, there are other types of fire?'
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] You can temper diamond armor the same way you would metals, it makes the crystal structure much more solid'
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] You can improve the durability of most metal items by heating them and cooling them on a cauldron, definitely recommend.'
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] When you first start out the things you make may not be of very high quality, but keep trying. You can make some extremely good stuff later'
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] If you''re not very experienced working a certain material, try something more simple and learn whatever you can from that'
      PICKAXE|AXE|SHOVEL|HOE:
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] I reckon you can temper tools the same way you can armor, but that''s not really my expertise'
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] I don''t really make tools, you should ask a tool smith for tips.'
      AXE|SWORD:
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] You can probably sharpen weapons on a grindstone, you should probably ask the weapon smith'
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] Metal tends to be kind of soft when it''s not tempered, that might be why your weapons break quickly.'
      NETHERITE_INGOT:
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] That''s an impressive find right there, but you can''t really do much with it unless you got a forge hot enough for it'
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] Very strange material. It''s not quite a metal and not quite crystalline, and regular fire doesn''t even seem to touch it'
      DIAMOND:
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] Diamonds aren''t metals, so you can''t really melt them. You can make them unstable with ender pearls, though'
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] Once you make a diamond unstable you can shape it kind of like a metal without breaking your anvil or hammer'
      IRON_INGOT|GOLD_INGOT:
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] Very versatile materials. You gotta heat them up on a campfire before you can start working them which you can do on an anvil.'
        - '&7[&8Armorer&7] Metal items tend to be kind of soft and weak when just forged, try tempering them first.'

  TOOLSMITH:
    dialogue:
      PICKAXE|AXE|SHOVEL|HOE:
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] If you''re not very experienced in a more advanced material but want something that lasts longer, you''re better off using what you''re used to'
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] You can''t really wax stone tools, but you can temper them to improve their durability. '
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] If you can get your hands on some honeycomb, try melt it and coat your wooden stuff in it. Makes it last a bit longer'
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] Apperently there''s a metal from the Nether that doesn''t melt by normal means, would love to get my hands on some'
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] Campfires are very useful in getting metals hot enough to for forging and preparing them for tempering'
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] Smithing is a lot about gathering knowledge, try experimenting and discovering new techniques'
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] A smithing bench allows me to swap out the head of my tool to something else, so I don''t lose enchantments on an item I like'
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] To be able to shape diamonds you have to make them unstable with ender pearls, something about ender pearls makes diamond more fluid or something'
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] Crafting tables aren''t really fit for forging with hot iron, so try using an anvil instead'
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] Diamond tools can be tempered much the same way as metal ones, by heating on a campfire and cooling on a cauldron'
      SWORD:
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] Swords tend to be a bit soft when newly forged, so tempering would probably make them a lot more durable.'
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] I''ve not really ever practiced weapon making, you''re better off asking the weapon smith. Could probably sharpen them though.'
      NETHERITE_INGOT:
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] You found some netherite? Impressive. Can''t help you figuring out how to work it though, my forge doesn''t even warm it up.'
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] Such a strange alien metal, you even wonder how it formed?'
      DIAMOND:
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] Diamonds are crystals, but adding some ender pearls to them makes them act more like a metal'
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] Contrary to popular belief, diamonds are actually not very strong. They''re hard, but brittle. To make them stronger you can temper them.'
      IRON_INGOT|GOLD_INGOT:
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] Metals can be soft and flexible or ridged and strong depending on how you treat it, my personal favourite to make things out of.'
        - '&7[&8Tool Smith&7] Metal items tend to be kind of soft and weak when just forged, try tempering them first.'

  WEAPONSMITH:
    dialogue:
      AXE|SWORD:
        - '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] If you wanna make your weapons sharper, use a grindstone. Mind that it shaves off any coating you put on it though'
        - '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] Wrap those weapon handles in some leather on a crafting bench and they''ll feel a lot better to hold'
        #- '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] Heard putting some fancy runes on your weapon makes enchantments stick better on them, wouldn''t know how but it sounds neat'
        - '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] Get your hands on some polished andesite and make a whetstone out of it, get that razor sharp edge you''ve been looking for.'
        - '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] If you feel your weapons break too fast, they can be improved much the same way other tools: by tempering them'
        - '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] The better you get at this things the more damage your weapons deal, maybe you''ll become a legendary smith like me one day'
        - '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] Make sure you sharpen and temper a sword before trying to whetstone it, it''s too soft to properly sharpen otherwise'
        - '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] Did you know you can sharpen battleshields too? They can be pretty brutal when you''re skilled with them.'
      HOE|PICKAXE|SHOVEL:
        - '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] Yes, you can sharpen those too. Who wouldn''t want a sharp hoe?'
        - '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] If you want durability tempering tools or waxing wood ones is always the way to go. You can get ''em nice and sharp too'
      NETHERITE_INGOT:
        - '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] Damn, nice find. That metal right there can make the sharpest, most durable weapons available. Don''t work with it if you''re inexperienced, though. It would be a waste'
        - '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] You can use that right there to coat your diamond tools, kinda like reinforcing them. You''d need to find a way to get it hot though, but regular fire won''t do'
      DIAMOND:
        - '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] Diamond you can get really extremely sharp, but it tends to be a bit brittle if you haven''t tempered it'
        - '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] If you can get your hands on some ender pearls try to combine it with that diamond you got, then you can start making weapons out of it'
      IRON_INGOT|GOLD_INGOT:
        - '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] Versatile and flexible, can''t go wrong with weapons made out of metal. '
        - '&7[&8Weapon Smith&7] Heat some of that metal over a campfire and start working it on an anvil. Sharpen it a bit, temper it, whetstone it, wrap some leather on it, and you got a perfect weapon.'
